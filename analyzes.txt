BS Assets
---------
example 2017q4
-> Assets not present in 113
-> some have AssetsNet: 3 (0000355019-17-000032, 0000814676-17-000042, 0001551163-17-000187)
-> some don't have BS entries (maybe tagged the wrong way)
-> some don't show that position, for instance if they only have CurrentAssets: eg 0001213900-17-011833
