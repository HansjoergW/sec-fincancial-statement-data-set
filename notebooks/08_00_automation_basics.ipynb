    "- The automation features gives you the possibility to add additional processing steps after the default update steps: download of new zip files from SEC, transforming them to Parquet format and indexing them in the SQLite DB. This means, when a new zip file is detected at SEC, not only the mentioned three steps are automatcially executed but also additional steps that you define by yourself.\n",
    "- There are two hook methods you can define and use to implement additional logic. Both of them are activated by defining them in the configuration file.\n",
    "- The simpler of this two hook methods just receives the `Configuration` object and is called after the all updated steps, the default update stapes (downloading of zip files, transform to parquet, indexing) and additional user defined update steps, were executed.\n",
    "- The more complex one receives a `Configuration` object and has to return a list of instances derived from `AbstractProcess`. There are some basic implementations of `AbstractProcess`, that can be used to filter, concat, and standardize the data.\n",
    "- The library contains an example implementation of a hook function which filters the data and also directly applies the standardizer for balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow. See below on how it is implemented and how it can be directly used."
