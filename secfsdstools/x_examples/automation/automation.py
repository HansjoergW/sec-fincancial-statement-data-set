"""
This module shows the automation possibilities.
These are mainly providing a hook method, which can create additional steps that are executed
during the "check-for-update" (checking whether a new quarterly zip file is available), and
providing another hook-method, that is simply called at the end of the whole update process.

As a remainder, the framework executes all update steps (check and downloading new zip files,
transforming them to parquet, indexing the reports, and any additional steps that you define
as shown here.

Usually, you can configure these methods here in the secfsdstools configuration file, like
<pre>
[DEFAULT]
downloaddirectory = ...
dbdirectory = ...
parquetdirectory = ...
useragentemail = ...
autoupdate = True
keepzipfiles = False
postppdatehook=secfsdstools.x_examples.automation.automation.after_update
postupdateprocesses=secfsdstools.x_examples.automation.automation.define_extra_processes
</pre>

In this example, we have a config file "automation_config.cfg" which we are going to use in the
__main__ section of this module.

    # update process to run, but at most once every 24 hours.
