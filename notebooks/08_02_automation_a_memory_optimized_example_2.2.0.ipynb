    "## A working example of the postupdateprocesses function: `secfsdstools.x_examples.automation.memory_optimized_automation.define_extra_processes` (introduced in 2.2.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this pipeline creates\n",
    "\n",
    "It result in creating the following bags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a single joined bag per statement (BS, IS, CF, ..) that will contain the data from all available quarters.\n",
    "- single standardized bags for each of BS, IS, CF which contain data from all the available quarters.\n",
    "- a single joined bag containing all the data from all statements from all available quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, all these bags are updated in an efficient way, as soon as new data becomes available at the SEC website.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version has a low memory footprint and should run without any problems on 16 GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use the example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this function directly by adding it to your configuration file together with some additional configuration parameters used by it: \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "[DEFAULT]\n",
    "...\n",
    "postupdateprocesses=secfsdstools.x_examples.automation.memory_optimized_automation.define_extra_processes\n",

    "[Filter]\n",
    "filtered_joined_by_stmt_dir = C:/data/sec/automated/_1_by_quarter/_1_filtered_joined_by_stmt\n",
    "parallelize = True\n",
    "\n",
    "[Standardizer]\n",
    "standardized_by_stmt_dir = C:/data/sec/automated/_1_by_quarter/_2_standardized_by_stmt\n",
    "\n",
    "[Concat]\n",

    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will add 5 additional steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step creates a joined bag for every zip file which is filtered for 10-K and 10-Q reports only\n",
    "and also applies the filters `ReportPeriodRawFilter`, `MainCoregRawFilter`, `USDOnlyRawFilter`, `OfficialTagsOnlyRawFilter`. \n",
    "Furthermore, the data is also split by stmt. If you set `parallelize = False`, the step will use less memory in the initial run\n",
    "but be a little bit slower. Once the available data from all the past quarters were processed, it actually shouldn't matter anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtered joined bag is stored under the path that is defined under `filtered_dir_by_stmt_joined` in the configuration file.\n",
    "The resulting directory structure will look like this:\n",

    "The fourth step concatenates the results from the third step into a single bag. \n",
