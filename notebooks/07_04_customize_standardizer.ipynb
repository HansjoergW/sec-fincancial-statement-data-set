By default, these are the columns `cik`, `name` (the last registered name of the company), `form` (either 10-K or 10Q), `fye` (the financial year ending as MMDD), `fy` (the financial year to which the report belongs), `fp` (the financial period Q1, Q2, Q3, or FY), `filed` (date when the report was filed with the SEC as an integer value in the format YYYYMMDD), `data` (same as `filed` but as areal date format).\n",
