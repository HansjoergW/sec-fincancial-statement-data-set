    "* **Raw Processing** <br/> Once the data is collected, the collected data for sub.txt, pre.txt, and num.txt is available\n",
    "as a pandas dataframe. Filters can be applied, the content can directly be saved and loaded.\n",
    "* **Joined Processing** <br/> From the \"Raw Data\", a \"joined\" representation can be created. This joins the data from\n",
