    "\n",
    "In its Financial Statement Data Sets, the SEC provides preprocessed data for all filed reports. However, one major drawback is that this data is only provided quarterly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overome this, version 2.4.0 introduced daily updates by downloading the raw information of new filed reports and replicating the preprocessing that the SEC does in its Financial Statement Data Sets. https://github.com/HansjoergW/sec-financial-statement-data-set-daily-processing is used for that.\n"

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "In the update process, which either can be triggered manually or runs automatically if not turned off in the configuration, the following main steps are executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is checked if a new quarterly zip file is available at the SEC.gov\n",
    "1. If a new quarterly zip file is available\n",
    "   1. It is downloaded, transformed to parquet and added to the index table\n",
    "   1. If there were formerly downloaded and preprocessed raw data of filed reports that are now covered by the downloaded quarterly zip file\n",
    "      1. The information for them are cleaned, so that only the official quarterly data remains\n",
    "1. It checks if reports are available that are not covered yet by the quarterly zip files\n",
    "   1. If reports not yet covered by quarterly zip files are available, the raw data of these reports is downloaded, preprocessed in the same way as the SEC does, transformed to parquet and added to the index table.\n",
    "1. Any configured automation pipelines are running\n"
