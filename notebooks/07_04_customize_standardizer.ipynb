    "# Customize Standardizer\n",
    "This Notebook gives some ideas how you could customize the standardizer classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three standardizer classes `BalanceSheetStandardizer`, `IncomeStatementStandardizer`, and `CashFlowStandardizer` are derived from the same base class `Standardizer` and share the same constructor parameters. In fact, the whole behavior of the standardizer is defined by these parameters and the three standardizer classes are just containers which define the values for the constructor parameters but do not define additional methods or overwrite existing methods. So, it is simply a configuration of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since every constructor parameter can be overwritten when instantiating one of the three standardizer classes, you can customize the standardizer in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simply adapt the parameters of the constructor when you instantiate `BalanceSheetStandardizer`, `IncomeStatementStandardizer`, or `CashFlowStandardizer`. A simply way, for instance, to adapt the list of tags/columns that should appear in the final result.\n",
    "2. Create a sublcass of `BalanceSheetStandardizer`, `IncomeStatementStandardizer`, or `CashFlowStandardizer` and redefine certain, more complex rules. For instance, maybe you want to define additional `Validation` rules, or you want to change the `Post` rules so that NaN-values are not set to zero but instead stay undefined.\n",
    "3. Create a subclass directly from `Standardizer` and define everything yourself."

In contrary, when you use the `present` method, the resulting data frame is enriched with additional information from the sub_df. By default, these are the columns `cik`, `name` (the last registered name of the company), `form` (either 10-K or 10Q), `fye` (the financial year ending as MMDD), `fy` (the financial year to which the report belongs), `fp` (the financial period Q1, Q2, Q3, or FY), `filed` (date when the report was filed with the SEC as an integer value in the format YYYYMMDD), `data` (same as `filed` but as areal date format).\n",
