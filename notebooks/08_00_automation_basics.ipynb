    "- The automation features gives you the possibility to add additional processing steps after the default update steps: download of new zip files from SEC, transforming them to Parquet format and indexing them in the SQLite DB. This means, when a new zip file is detected at SEC, not only the mentioned three steps are automatcially executed but also additional steps that you define by yourself.\n",
    "- There are two hook methods you can define and use to implement additional logic. Both of them are activated by defining them in the configuration file.\n",
    "- The simpler of this two hook methods just receives the `Configuration` object and is called after the all updated steps, the default update stapes (downloading of zip files, transform to parquet, indexing) and additional user defined update steps, were executed.\n",
    "- The more complex one receives a `Configuration` object and has to return a list of instances derived from `AbstractProcess`. There are some basic implementations of `AbstractProcess`, that can be used to filter, concat, and standardize the data. These implementeations are also used in the example implementation described in this notebook.\n",
    "- You have to keep an eye on the memory usage, depending on what you do"
